# üß† Dementia Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts dementia based on clinical and MRI scan data. The model utilizes various patient attributes including cognitive test scores, brain volume measurements, and demographic information to support early diagnosis of dementia.

## üìÅ Dataset Features

The dataset contains the following columns:

| Feature       | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Visit`       | Clinical visit number |
| `MR Delay`    | Days between the clinical visit and MRI scan |
| `M/F`         | Gender of the patient (M = Male, F = Female) |
| `Hand`        | Dominant hand (R = Right, L = Left) |
| `Age`         | Age of the patient in years |
| `EDUC`        | Years of formal education completed |
| `SES`         | Socioeconomic status  |
| `MMSE`        | Mini-Mental State Examination score  |
| `CDR`         | Clinical Dementia Rating |
| `eTIV`        | Estimated Total Intracranial Volume |
| `nWBV`        | Normalized Whole Brain Volume |
| `ASF`         | Atlas Scaling Factor |
